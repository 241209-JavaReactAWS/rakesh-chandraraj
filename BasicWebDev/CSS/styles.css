/* This is an external stylesheet, and it will be what you use the majority of the time to style your elements. 
    Why would we use this as a default? This can be used in several different files at once (inline and internal
    can only be used in one file at a time). 

    It has the lowest priority (barring any !important things) meaning if you need to change the styling specifically, 
    you can. It's easy to overwrite it.
