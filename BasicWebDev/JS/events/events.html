    <!-- 
    In web development, we use events to mark interactions with the page and elements on the page 
    - Click 
    - DblClick 
    - MouseOver 
    - KeyDown 
    - ect. 
    
    Our goal will be to "listen" for when some of these events occur and do some operations when they do 
    -->

    <h1>Register a new user:</h1>

    <!-- We haven't talked too much about adding in user input, but the easiest way is with an input tag -->
    <label for="usernameInput">Username: </label>
    <input id="usernameInput" type="text" placeholder="Username" onmouseover="usernameMouseOver()">
    <br>
    <br>
    <label for="passwordInput">Password: </label>
    <input id="passwordInput" type="password" maxlength="50">
    <br>
    <br>
    <!-- Able to call the function when the button is called through JS (events.js) -->
    <button id="createUserButton">Register New User!</button>
    <!-- Able to call the function when the button is clicked through HTML -->
    <!-- <button id="createUserButton" onclick="submitNewUser()">Register New User!</button> -->

    <!-- GOAL: make something happen when the register button is clicked! -->
    <script src="./events.js"></script>
