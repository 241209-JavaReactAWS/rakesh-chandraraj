            He graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with a Bachelors in CS. Formerly Finance, before he 
            switch majors. <br>
            One class of note was Calc 2 (which he passed on his first try). He had a great teacher, but barely 
            scraped due to just how tough the class was. <br>
            In his free time, he's a dungeon master for D&D, and uses creative writing to create worlds for players. <br>
